# Gaussian-Filter
# Gaussian Filter: Signal Smoothing Comparison (MATLAB &amp; Python)  This small project demonstrates how Gaussian filters can be used to smooth a noisy signal using both **MATLAB** and **Python** implementations. It compares the effect of using a small vs. large window for smoothing, and visualizes the results.
